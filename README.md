- [ ] Make sure what youâ€™re measuring (variables) to answer your question is clear

**Background & Prior Work**:
- [ ] Include explanation of what work has been done previously
- [ ] Include citations or links to previous work
- [ ] Include an explanation of dataset(s) used (*i.e.*, how the data was collected, features/variables included, number of observations, information in dataset)

**Hypothesis**:
- [ ] Include your team's hypothesis
- [ ] Ensure that this hypothesis is clear to readers
- [ ] Explain why you think this will be the outcome (what was your thinking?)

### Data Analysis:
**Dataset(s)**
- [ ] Describe your dataset(s), and link to their source(s)

**Data Wrangling**

**Data Visualization**:
- [ ] Include at least three visualizations
- [ ] Clearly label all axes on plots
- [ ] Type of all plots appropriate given data displayed
- [ ] Interpretation of each visualization included in the text

**Data Analysis & Results**:
- [ ] Appropriate analysis performed
- [ ] Output of analysis interpreted and interpretation included in notebook

### Conclusion & Discussion:
- [ ] Discussion of your results and how they address your experimental question
- [ ] Limitations of analysis discussed
- [ ] What additional experiments would be interesting, and what data would you need?

### Final Checks:
- [ ] Edit all text for clarity
- [ ] Remove all instructions
- [ ] Be sure text included throughout to guide reader
- [ ] Check to make sure all text and images are visible
- [ ] Names included
- [ ] Renamed file : `FinalProject-GroupXYZ.ipynb`, where 'XYZ' is replaced by your group's project name
