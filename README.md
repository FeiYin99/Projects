## Final Project Checklist

You can use this checklist to help guide your thinking on the final project. If you check off all the boxes below, you should be in good shape to get a perfect score on your final project.

### I.	Introduction & Background (20%)

**Overview**:
- [ ] Write a clear summary of what you did
- [ ] Limit overview to 3-4 sentences

**Research Question**:
- [ ] Include your *specific* data science question
- [ ] Make sure what youâ€™re measuring (variables) to answer your question is clear

**Background & Prior Work**:
- [ ] Include explanation of what work has been done previously
- [ ] Include citations or links to previous work
- [ ] Include an explanation of dataset(s) used (*i.e.*, how the data was collected, features/variables included, number of observations, information in dataset)

**Hypothesis**:
- [ ] Include your team's hypothesis
- [ ] Ensure that this hypothesis is clear to readers
- [ ] Explain why you think this will be the outcome (what was your thinking?)

### Data Analysis:

**Data Wrangling**
- [ ] Pull your data into Python and explain steps taken to isolate the data you need

**Data Visualization**:
- [ ] Include at least three visualizations
- [ ] Clearly label all axes on plots
- [ ] Type of all plots appropriate given data displayed
- [ ] Interpretation of each visualization included in the text

**Data Analysis & Results**:
- [ ] Appropriate analysis performed
- [ ] Output of analysis interpreted and interpretation included in notebook

### Conclusion & Discussion:
- [ ] Discussion of your results and how they address your experimental question
- [ ] Limitations of analysis discussed
- [ ] What additional experiments would be interesting, and what data would you need?

### Final Checks:
- [ ] Edit all text for clarity
- [ ] Remove all instructions
- [ ] Be sure text included throughout to guide reader
- [ ] Check to make sure all text and images are visible
- [ ] Names included
- [ ] Renamed file : `FinalProject-GroupXYZ.ipynb`, where 'XYZ' is replaced by your group's project name
